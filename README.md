How to show excel files inside the WinForms webbrowser control.

### Prerequisites
You must have OWC up and runngin on your machine.

### How to build
Go to ./src and run build.bat. The output will be at ./bin.

There's no .sln or .csproj file in here, just plain old C# compiling from the command line using csc.exe. 
If you wanna use VS, make sure your build targets the x86 platform. Otherwise, it ain't gonna work.

### More about the code
You can see some commets about the interesting bits of the code at [my blog](http://alemiralles.blogspot.com.ar/2016/10/how-to-show-excel-files-inside-net.html)
